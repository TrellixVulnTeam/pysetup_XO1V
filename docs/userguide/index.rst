Building and Distributing Packages with Setuptools
==================================================

``Setuptools`` is a collection of enhancements to the Python ``distutils``
that allow developers to more easily build and
distribute Python packages, especially ones that have dependencies on other
packages.

Packages built and distributed using ``setuptools`` look to the user like
ordinary Python packages based on the ``distutils``.
